# virtual-ekam
Now you too can experience my friend Ekam right in your own home.

I was bored one day so I made this. When you click the button of Ekam's face it says "bitches" and displays a quote from A Song of Ice and Fire. Much like the real Ekam. VirtualEkam1.4.jar is a runnable version I put together, everything else is the source code from Eclipse. I'm still new to GitHub so sorry if the way I committed the files isn't standard.

I made this the first semester of freshman year so that's why I made some weird design decisions.
