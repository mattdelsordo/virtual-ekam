A Lannister always pays his debts
A dragon is not a slave
A lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of sheep
As High As Honor
Chaos is a ladder
Ever Vigilant
Family, Duty, Honor
Fear cuts deeper than swords
Fire and Blood
Hear Me Roar
I am the god of tits and wine
I am the sword in the darkness
I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room
It is known
Let Me Soar
Not today
Now you've woken the dragon
Ours is the Fury
The Lannisters send their regards
The North Remembers
The things I do for love
This is not the day I die
Though All Men Do Despise Us
Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken
What do we say to the god of death
What is Dead Can Never Die
When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die
Where do whores go
Winter is Coming
You know nothing
